name = "Definitions Only";
description = "File is definition only.

Definition-only files only include structure definitions : class, functions, traits, interfaces, constants, global, declare(), use and include().

Some functioncalls are also considered definition only, as they configure PHP, but don't process data : 
* ini_set()
* error_reporting
* register_shutdown_function()
* set_session_handler()
* set_error_handler()
* spl_autoload_register()


File A : 
<?php

// This file has only definitions
function foo() {}

define('a', 1);

class bar {}

?>

File B : 
<?php

// This file has only definitions
function foo() {}

define('a', 1);

class bar {}

?>
