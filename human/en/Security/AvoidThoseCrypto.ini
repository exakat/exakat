name = "Avoid Those Hash Functions";
description = "The following cryptographic algorithms are considered unsecure, and should be replaced with new and more performant algorithms. 

MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA0, SHA1, CRC, DES, 3DES, RC2, RC4. 

When possible, avoid using them, may it be as PHP functions, or hashing function configurations (mcrypt, hash...).

<?php

// Weak cryptographic algorithm
echo md5('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');

// Weak crypotgraphic algorthim, used with a modern PHP extension (easier to update)
echo hash('md5', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');

// Strong crypotgraphic algorthim, used with a modern PHP extension
echo hash('sha156', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');

?>

Weak crypto are commonly used for hashing values when caching them. In such cases, security is not a primary concern. However, it may later become such, when hackers get access to the cache folders, or if the cached identifier is published. As a preventive protection, it is recommended to always use a secure hashing function.
