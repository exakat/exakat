name = "Mkdir Default";
description = "mkdir() gives universal access to created folders, by default. It is recommended to gives a more limited set of rights (0755, 0700), or to explicitely set the rights to 0777. 

<?php

// By default, this dir is 777
mkdir('/path/to/dir');

// Explicitely, this is wanted. It may also be audited easily
mkdir('/path/to/dir', 0777);

// This dir is limited to the current user. 
mkdir('/path/to/dir', 0700);
