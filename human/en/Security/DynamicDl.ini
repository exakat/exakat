description = "Loading a variable dynamically requires a lot of care in the preparation of the library name. 

In case of injection in the variable, the dynamic loading of a library gives a lot of power to an intruder. 

<?php

    // dynamically loading a library
	dl($library. PHP_SHLIB_SUFFIX);

    // dynamically loading ext/vips
	dl('vips.' . PHP_SHLIB_SUFFIX);

?>
