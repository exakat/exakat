description = "It is advised to always use CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST when requesting a SSL connexion. 

With those tests (by default), the certificate is verified, and if it isn't valided, the connexion fails : this is a safe behavior.

<?php
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, https://www.php.net/);

// To be safe, always set this to true
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);
