description = "sleep() and usleep() help saturate the web server. 

Pausing the script for a specific amount of time means that the Web server is also making all related resources sleep, such as database, sockets, session, etc. This may used to set up a DOS on the server.  

<?php

$begin = microtime(true);
checkLogin($user, $password);
$end   = microtime(true);

// Making all login checks looks the same
usleep(1000000 - ($end - $begin) * 1000000); 

// Any hit on this page now uses 1 second, no matter if load is high or not
// Is it now possible to saturate the webserver in 1 s ? 

?>

As much as possible, avoid delaying the end of the script. 

sleep() and usleep() have less impact in commandline (`CLI`).
