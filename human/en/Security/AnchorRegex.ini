Without ^ and $, the regex is searches for any pattern that satisfies its criteria, leaving any unused part of the string available for abitrary content. It is recommended to use both anchor

<?php

$birthday = getSomeDate($_GET);

// Permissive version : $birthday = '1970-01-01<script>xss();</script>';
if (!preg_match('/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/', $birthday) {
    error('Wrong data format for your birthday!');
}

// Restrictive version : $birthday = '1970-01-01';
if (!preg_match('/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/', $birthday) {
    error('Wrong data format for your birthday!');
}

echo 'Your birthday is on '.$birthday;

?>

Note that $ may be a line ending, still leaving room after it for injection.

<?php

$birthday = '1970-01-01'.PHP_EOL.'<script>xss();</script>';

?>

This analysis reports false positive when the regex is used to search a pattern in a much larger string. Check if this rule doesn't apply, though.
