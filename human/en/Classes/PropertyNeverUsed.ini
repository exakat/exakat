description = "Properties that are never used. They are defined in a class or a trait, but they never actually used.

Properties are considered used when they are used locally, in the same class as their definition, or in a parent class : a parent class is always included with the current class. 

On the other hand, properties which are defined in a class, but only used in children classes is considered unused, since children may also avoid using it.
