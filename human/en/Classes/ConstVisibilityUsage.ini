name = "Const Visibility Usage";
description = "Visibility for class constant controls the accessibility to class constant.

A public constant may be used anywhere in the code; a protected constant usage is restricted to the class and its relatives; a private constant is restricted to itself.

This feature was introduced in PHP 7.1. It is recommended to use explicit visibility, and, whenever possible, make the visibility private.

<?php

class x {
    public const a = 1;
    protected const b = 2;
    private const c = 3;
    const d = 4;
}

interface i {
    public const a = 1;
      const d = 4;
}

?>
