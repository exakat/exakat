This error may be detected when the classes are all in the same file : then, PHP reports the problem. However, when the classes are separated in different files, as it is customary, PHP won't check this at linting time, yielding a fatal error at execution time. 

First file.

<?php

class Foo {
    public $publicProperty;
    protected $protectedProperty;
    private $privateProperty;
}
?>

Second file.

<?php

class Bar extends Foo {
    private $publicProperty;
    private $protectedProperty;
    private $privateProperty;   // This one is OK
}
?>
