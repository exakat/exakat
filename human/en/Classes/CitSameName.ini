name = "Class, Interface Or Trait With Identical Names";
description = "The following names are used at the same time for classes, interfaces or traits. For example, 

<?php
    class a     { /* some definitions */ }
    interface a { /* some definitions */ }
    trait a     { /* some definitions */ }
?>

Even if they are in different namespaces, identical names makes classes easy to confuse. This is often solved by using alias at import time : this leads to more confusion, as a class suddenly changes its name. 

Internally, PHP use the same list for all classes, interfaces and traits. As such, it is not allowed to have both a trait and a class with the same name.

In PHP 4, and PHP 5 before namespaces, it was not possible to have classes with the same name. They were simply included after a check.

";
explain="Most Element classes extends ModelEntity, which is an abstract class. There is also an interface, called Element, for forms. And, last, one of the class Element extends JsonSerializable, which is a PHP native interface. Namespaces are definitely crucial to understand which Element is which. "

code="interface Storage extends \OCP\Files\Storage { /**/ }
";
explain="Interface Storage extends another Storage class. Here, the fully qualified name is used, so we can understand which storage is which at read time : a 'use' alias would make this line more confusing."
