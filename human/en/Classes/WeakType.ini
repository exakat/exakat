explain="The is_null() test detects a special situation, that requires usage of default values. The 'else' handles every other situations, including when the $node is an object, or anything else. $this->getNode() will gain from having typehints : it may be NULL, or the results of mysqli_fetch_object() : a stdClass object. The expected properties of nleft and nright are not certain to be available."
