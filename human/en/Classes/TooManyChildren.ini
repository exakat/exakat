description = "Those classes have more than 15 children. It is worth checking if they cannot be refactored in anyway.

There is no technical limitation of the number of children and grand-children for a class. 

<?php

// parent class
// calling it grandparent to avoid confusion with 'parent'
class grandparent {}


class children1 extends grandparent {}

class children3 extends grandparent {}
class children4 extends grandparent {}
class children5 extends grandparent {}
class children6 extends grandparent {}

class children9 extends grandparent {}
class children11 extends grandparent {}
class children12 extends grandparent {}
class children13 extends grandparent {}
class children14 extends grandparent {}
class children15 extends grandparent {}
class children16 extends grandparent {}
class children17 extends grandparent {}
