name = "Properties Declaration Consistence";
description = "Properties may be declared all at once, or one by one. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that choosing unique declarations or multiple depends on coding style and files.
