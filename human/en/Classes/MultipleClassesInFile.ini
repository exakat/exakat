name = "Multiple Classes In One File";
description = "It is regarded as a bad practice to store several classes in the same file. This is usually done to make life of __autoload() easier. 

It is often unexpected to find class ``foo`` in the ``bar.php`` file. This is also the case for interfaces and traits.

<?php

// three classes in the same file
class foo {}
class bar {}
class foobar{}

?>

One good reason to have multiple classes in one file is to reduce include time by providing everything into one nice include.
