name = "Method Could Be Static";
description = "A method that doesn't make any usage of $this could be turned into a static method. 

While static methods are usually harder to handle, recognizing the static status is a first step before turning the method into a standalone function.

<?php

class foo {
    static $property = 1;
    
    // legit static method
    static function staticMethod() {
        return self::$property;
    }

    // This is not using $this, and could be static
    function nonStaticMethod() {
        return self::$property;
    }

    // This is not using $this nor self, could be a standalone function
    function nonStaticMethod() {
        return self::$property;
    }
}

?>
