description = "Avoid optional properties, to prevent littering the code with existence checks. 

When a property has to be checked once for existence, it is safer to check it each time. This leads to a decrease in readability.

Either make sure the property is set with an actual object rather than with null, or use a void object. A void object offers the same interface than the expected object, but does nothing. It allows calling its methods, without running into a Fatal error, nor testing it. 

<?php

// Example is courtesy 'The Coding Machine' : it has been adapted from its original form. See link below.

class MyMailer {
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger = null) {
        $this->logger = $logger;
    }

    private function sendMail(Mail $mail) {
        // Since $this->logger may be null, it must be tested anytime it is used.
        if ($this->logger) {
            $this->logger->info('Mail successfully sent.');
        }
    }
}
