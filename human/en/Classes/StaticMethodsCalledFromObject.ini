name = "Static methods called from object";
description = "Static methods may be called without instantiating an object.
As such, they never interact with the special variable \'$this\', as they do not
depend on object existence. 

Besides this, static methods are normal methods that may be called directly from
object context, to perform some utility task. 

To maintain code readability, it is recommended to call static method in a static
way, rather than within object context.

class x {
    static function y() {}
}

$z = new x();

$z->y(); // Readability : no one knows it is a static call
x::y();  // Readability : here we know

";
