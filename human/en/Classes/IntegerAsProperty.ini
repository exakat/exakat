name = "Integer As Property";
description = "It is backward incompatible to use integers are property names. This feature was introduced in PHP 7.2.

If the code must be compatible with previous versions, avoid casting arrays to object.

<?php

// array to object
$arr = [0 => 1];
$obj = (object) $arr;
var_dump(
    $obj,
    $obj->{'0'}, // PHP 7.2+ accessible
    $obj->{0} // PHP 7.2+ accessible

    $obj->{'b'}, // always been accessible
);
?>
