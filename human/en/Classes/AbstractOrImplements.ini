explain="The class MassEditProgressView extends ProgressView, which is an abstract class. That class defines one abstract method : abstract protected function headerLabelPrefixContent(). Yet, the class MassEditProgressView doesn't implements this method. This means that the class can't be instatiated, and indeed, it isn't. The class MassEditProgressView is subclassed, by the class MarketingListMembersMassSubscribeProgressView, which implements the method headerLabelPrefixContent(). As such, MassEditProgressView should be marked abstract, so as to prevent any instantiation attempt. "
