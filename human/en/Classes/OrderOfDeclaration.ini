Optional characteristics, like final, static... are not specified. Special methods names are not specified. 

<?php

class x {
    use traits;
    
    const CONSTANTS = 1;
    const CONSTANTS2 = 1;
    const CONSTANTS3 = 1;
    
    private $property = 2;
    private $property2 = 2;
    private $property3 = 2;
    
    public function foo() {}
    public function foo2() {}
    public function foo3() {}
    public function foo4() {}
