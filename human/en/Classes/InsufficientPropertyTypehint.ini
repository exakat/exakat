name = "Insufficient Property Typehint";
description = "The typehint used for a class property doesn't cover all it usage.

The typehint is insufficient when a undefined method is called, or if members are access while the typehint is an interface.

<?php

class A {
    function a1() {}
}

// PHP 7.4 and more recent
class B {
    private A $a = null;
    
    function b2() {
        // this method is available in A
        $this->a->a1();
        // this method is NOT available in A
        $this->a->a2();
    }
}

// Supported by all PHP versions
class C {
    private $a = null;

    function __construct(A $a) {
        $this->a = $a;
    }
    
    function b2() {
        // this method is available in A
        $this->a->a1();
        // this method is NOT available in A
        $this->a->a2();
    }
}

?>

This analysis relies on typehinted properties, as introduced in PHP 7.4. It also relies on typehinted assignations at construct time : the typehint of the assigned argument will be used as the property typehint. Getters and setters are not considered here.
