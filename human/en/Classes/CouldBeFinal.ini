name = "Class Could Be Final";
description = "Any class that has no extension should be ``final`` by default.

As stated by `Matthias Noback` : ``If a class is not marked final, it has at least one subclass``.

Prevent your classes from being subclassed by making them ``final``. Sometimes, classes are not meant or thought to be derivable.

<?php

class x {}            // This class is extended
class y extends x {}  // This class is extended
class z extends y {}  // This class is not extended

final class z2 extends y {}  // This class is not extended

?>
