name = "Use Instanceof";
description = "The ``instanceof`` operator is a more precise alternative to ``is_object()``. It is also faster.

instanceof checks for an variable to be of a class or its parents or the interfaces it implements. 
Once ``instanceof`` has been used, the actual attributes available (properties, constants, methods) are known, unlike with ``is_object()``.

Last, ``instanceof`` may be upgraded to Typehint, by moving it to the method signature. 

<?php

class Foo {

    // Don't use is_object
    public function bar($o) {
        if (!is_object($o)) { return false; } // Classic argument check
        return $o->method();
    }

    // use instanceof
    public function bar($o) {
        if ($o instanceof myClass) {  // Now, we know which methods are available
            return $o->method();
        }
        
        return false; } // Default behavior
    }

    // use of typehinting
    // in case $o is not of the right type, exception is raised automatically
    public function bar(myClass $o) {
        return $o->method();
    }
}

?>

``instanceof`` and ``is_object()`` may not be always interchangeable. Consider using isset on a known property for a simple check on object. You may also consider is_string(), is_integer() or is_scalar(), in particular instead of ``!is_object()``.

The ``instanceof`` operator is also faster than the ``is_object()`` functioncall.

";
explain="In this code, ``is_object()`` is used to check the status of the order. Possibly, $order is false or null in case of incompatible status. Yet, when $object is an object, and in particular being a global that may be assigned anywhere else in the code, it seems that the method 'update_status' is magically always available. Here, using instance of to make sure that $order is an 'paypal' class, or a 'storepickup' or any of the payment class.  "
