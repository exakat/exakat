name = "Make Global A Property";
description = "Calling global (or $GLOBALS) in methods is slower and less testable than setting the global to a property, and using this property.

Using properties is slightly faster than calling global or $GLOBALS, though the gain is not important. 

Setting the property in the constructor (or in a factory), makes the class easier to test, as there is now a single point of configuration.
