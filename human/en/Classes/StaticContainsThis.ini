name = "Static Methods Can't Contain $this";
description = "Static methods are also called ``class methods`` : they may be called even if the class has no instantiated object. Thus, the local variable ``$this`` won't exist, PHP will set it to NULL as usual. 

<?php

class foo {
    // Static method may access other static methods, or property, or none. 
    static function staticBar() {
        // This is not possible in a static method
        return self::otherStaticBar() . static::$staticProperty;
    }

    static function bar() {
        // This is not possible in a static method
        return $this->property;
    }

}

?>

Either this is not a static method, which is fixed by removing the ``static`` keyword, or replace all $this mention by static properties ``Class::$property``.
