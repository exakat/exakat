name = "Simple Switch";
description = "Switches are faster when relying only on integers or strings.

Since PHP 7.2, simple switches that use only strings or integers are optimized. The gain is as great as the switch is big. 

<?php

// Optimized switch. 
switch($b) {
    case \"a\":
        break;
    case \"b\":
        break;
    case \"c\":
        break;
    case \"d\":
        break;
    default :
        break;
}

// Unoptimized switch. 
// Try moving the foo() call in the default, to keep the rest of the switch optimized.
switch($c) {
    case \"a\":
        break;
    case foo($b):
        break;
    case \"c\":
        break;
    case \"d\":
        break;
    default :
        break;
}

?>
