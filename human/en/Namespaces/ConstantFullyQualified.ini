name = "Fully Qualified Constants";
description = "When defining constants with define() function, it is possible to include the actual namespace : 

define(\'a\\b\\c\', 1); 

However, the name should be fully qualified without the initial \\. Here, \\a\\b\\c constant will never be accessible as a namespace constant, though it will be accessible via the constant() function.

Also, the namespace will be absolute, and not a relative namespace of the current one. ";
