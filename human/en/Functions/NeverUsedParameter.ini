description = "When a parameter is never used at calltime, it may be turned into a local variable.

It seems that the parameter was set up initially, but never found its practical usage. It is never mentioned, and always fall back on its default value.  

Parameter without a default value are reported by PHP, and are usually always filled. 

<?php

// $b may be turned into a local var, it is unused
function foo($a, $b = 1) {
    return $a + $b;
}

// whenever foo is called, the 2nd arg is not mentionned
foo($a);
foo(3);
foo('a');
foo($c);
