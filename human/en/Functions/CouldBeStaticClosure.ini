name = "Could Be Static Closure";
description = "Closure may be static, and prevent the import of ``$this``. 

By preventing the useless import of ``$this``, you avoid useless work. 

This also has the added value to prevent the usage of ``$this`` from the closure. This is a good security practice.

<?php

class Foo
{
    function __construct()
    {

        // Not possible to use $this
        $func = static function() {
            var_dump($this);
        };
        $func();

        // Normal import of $this
        $closure = function() {
            var_dump($this);
        };
    }
};
new Foo();

?>

This is a micro-optimisation. Apply it in case of intensive usage.
