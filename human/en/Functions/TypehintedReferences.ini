name = "Typehinted References";
description = "Typehinted arguments have no need for references. Since they are only an object, they are already a reference.

In fact, adding the & on the argument definition may lead to error like ``Only variables should be passed by reference``.

This applies to the 'object' type hint, but not the the others, such as int or bool.

<?php
    // a class
    class X {
        public $a = 3;
    }

    // typehinted reference
    //function foo(object &$x) works too
    function foo(X &$x) {
        $x->a = 1;
    
        return $x;
    }

    // Send an object 
    $y = foo(new X);

    // This prints 1;
    print $y->a;
?>
