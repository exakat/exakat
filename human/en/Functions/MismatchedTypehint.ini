name = "Mismatched Typehint";
description = "Relayed arguments don't have the same typehint.

Typehint acts as a filter method. When an object is checked with a first class, and then checked again with a second distinct class, the whole process is always false : $a can't be of two different classes at the same time.

<?php

// Foo() calls bar()
function foo(A $a, B $b) {
    bar($a, $b);
}

// $a is of A typehint in both methods, but 
// $b is of B then BB typehing
function bar(A $a, BB $b) {

}

?>

Note : This analysis currently doesn't check generalisation of classes : for example, when B is a child of BB, it is still reported as a mismatch.
