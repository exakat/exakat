name = "Only Variable For Reference";
description = "When a method is requesting an argument to be a reference, it cannot be called with a literal value.

The call must be made with a variable, or any assimilated data container : array, property or static property. 

<?php

// This is not possible
foo(1,2);

// This is working
foo($a, $b);

function foo($a, &$b) {}

?>

Note that PHP may detect this error at linting time, if the method is defined after being called : at that point, PHP will only check the problem during execution. This is definitely the case for methods, compared to functions or static methods.
