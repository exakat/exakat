description = "Avoid using classes as typehint : always use interfaces. This way, different classes, or versions of classes may be passed as argument. The typehint is not linked to an implementation, but to signatures.

<?php

class X {
    function foo() {}
}

interface i {
    function foo();
}

// X is a class : any update in the code requires changing / subclassing X or the rest of the code.
function bar(X $x) {
    $x->foo();
}

// I is an interface : X may implements this interface without refactoring and pass
// later, newer versions of X may get another name, but still implement I, and still pass
function bar2(I $x) {
    $x->foo();
