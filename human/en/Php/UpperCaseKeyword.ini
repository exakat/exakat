name = "Non-lowercase Keywords";
description = "Usual convention is to write PHP keywords (like as, foreach, switch, case, break, etc.) all in lowercase. 

<?php

// usual PHP convention
foreach($array as $element) {
    echo $element;
}

// unusual PHP conventions
Foreach($array AS $element) {
    eCHo $element;
}

?>

PHP do understand them in lowercase, UPPERCASE or WilDCase, so there is nothing compulsory here. Although, it will look strange to many. 

Some keywords are missing from this analysis : `extends`, `implements`, `as`. This is due to the internal engine, which doesn't keep track of them in its AST representation.
