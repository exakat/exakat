name = "No Reference For Static Property";
description = "Static properties used to behave independantly when set to a reference value. This was fixed in PHP 7.3. 

According to the PHP 7.3 changelog : ``In PHP, static properties are shared between inheriting classes, unless the static property is explicitly overridden in a child class. However, due to an implementation artifact it was possible to separate the static properties by assigning a reference. This loophole has been fixed.``.

<?php

        class Test {
            public static $x = 0;
        }
        class Test2 extends Test { }

        Test2::$x = &$x;
        $x = 1;

        var_dump(Test::$x, Test2::$x);
        // Previously: int(0), int(1)
        // Now: int(1), int(1)

?>
