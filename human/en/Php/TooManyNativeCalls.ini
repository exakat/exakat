description = "Avoid stuffing too many PHP native call inside another functioncall. 

For readability reasons, or, more often, for edge case handling, it is recommended to avoid nesting too many PHP native calls. 

This analysis reports any situation where more than 3 PHP native calls are nested.

<?php

// Too many nested functions 
$cleanArray = array_unique(array_keys(array_count_values(array_column($source, 'x'))));

// Avoid warning when source is empty
$extract = array_column($source, 'x');
if (empty($extract)) {
    $cleanArray = array();
} else {
    $cleanArray = array_unique(array_keys(array_count_values($extract)));
}

// This is not readable, although it is short. 
// It may easily get out of hand.
