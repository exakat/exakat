description = "The following functions are deprecated. It is recommended to stop using them now and replace them with a durable equivalent. 

Note that these functions may be still usable : they generate warning that help tracking their usage in the log. To eradicate their usage, watch the logs, and update any deprecated warning. This way, the code won't be stuck when the function is actually removed from PHP.
