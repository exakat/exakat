name = "Foreach Don't Change Pointer";
description = "``foreach`` loops use their own internal cursor.

A ``foreach`` loop won't change the internal pointer of the array, as it works on a copy of the source. Hence, applying array pointer's functions such as current() or next() to the source array won't have the same behavior in PHP 5 than PHP 7.

This only applies when a foreach() by reference is used.

<?php

$numbers = range(1, 10);
next($numbers);
foreach($numbers as &$number){
    print $number;
    print current($numbers)."\n"; // Always 
}

?>
