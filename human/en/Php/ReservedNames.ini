name="PHP Keywords as Names";
description="PHP has a set of reserved keywords. It is recommended not to use those keywords for names structures. 

PHP does check that a number of structures, such as classes, methods, interfaces... can't be named or called using one of the keywords. However, in a few other situations, no check are enforced. Using keywords in such situation is confusing. ";
