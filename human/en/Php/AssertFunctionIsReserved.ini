name = "Assert Function Is Reserved";
description = "Avoid defining an ``assert`` function in namespaces. 

While they work fine when the assertions are active (``zend.assertions=1``), calls to unqualified ``assert`` are optimized away when assertions are not active. 

Since PHP 7.3, a fatal error is emitted : ``Defining a custom assert() function is deprecated, as the function has special semantics``.

<?php
//      Run this with zend.assertions=1 and 
// Then run this with zend.assertions=0

namespace Test {
    function assert() {
        global $foo;

        $foo = true;
    }
}

namespace Test {
    assert();

    var_dump(isset($foo));
}

?>
