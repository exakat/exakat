name = "Inconsistant Closing Tag";
description = "Project usually chose between always closing a PHP script (such as <?php xxx(); ?>) or never closing it (<?php xxx(); ). The second is recommended to avoid leaving some whitespaces at the end of the script, and, thus, leading to the infamous 'Headers already sent' error. 

One way or another, if the project has a vast majority of either case, it will report the other here, so as to make things homogenous. If the project appears undecided about this issue, nothing will be reported.";
