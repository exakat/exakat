name = "Crypto Usage";
description = "Usage of cryptography and hashes functions. 

The functions listed are the native PHP functions, and do not belong to a specific extension, like ``OpenSSL``, ``mcrypt`` or ``mhash``.

Cryptography and hashes are mainly used for storing sensitive data, such as passwords, or to verify authenticity of data. They may also be used for name-randomization with cache.

<?php

if (md5($_POST['password']) === $row['password_hash']) {
    user_login($user);
} else {
    error('Wrong password');
}
?>
