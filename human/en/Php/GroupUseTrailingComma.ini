description = "The usage of a final empty slot in array() was allowed with use statements. This works in PHP 7.2 and more recent.

Although this empty instruction is ignored at execution, this allows for clean presentation of code, and short diff when committing in a VCS.

<?php

// Valid in PHP 7.2 and more recent.
use a\b\{c,

         e, 
         f,
        };

// This won't compile in 7.1 and older.
