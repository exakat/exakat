name = "Cant Use Return Value In Write Context";
description = "Empty() used to work only on data containers, such as variables. Until PHP 5.5, it was not possible to use directly expressions, such as functioncalls, inside an empty() function call : they were met with a 'Can't use function return value in write context' fatal error. 

<?php

function foo($boolean) {
    return $boolean;
}

// Valid since PHP 5.5
echo empty(foo(true)) : 'true' : 'false';

?>

This also applies to methodcalls, static or not.
