name = "Not A Scalar Type";
description = "int is the actual PHP scalar type, not integer. 

PHP 7 introduced several scalar types, in particular int, bool and float. Those three types are easily mistaken with integer, boolean, real and double. 

Unless you have created those classes, you may get some strange error messages.

<?php

// This expects a scalar of type 'integer'
function foo(int $i) {}

// This expects a object of class 'integer'
function abr(integer $i) {}

?>
