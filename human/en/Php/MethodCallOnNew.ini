name = "Methodcall On New";
description = "It is possible to call a method right at object instanciation. 

This syntax was added in PHP 5.4+. Before, this was not possible : the object had to be stored in a variable first.

<?php

// Data is collected
$data = data_source();

// Data is saved, but won't be reused from this databaseRow object. It may be ignored.
$result = (new databaseRow($data))->save();

// The actual result of the save() is collected and tested.
if ($result !== true) {
    processSaveError($data);
}

?>

This syntax is interesting when the object is not reused, and may be discarded
