name = "Direct Call To __clone";
description = "Direct call to magic method __clone() was forbidden. It is allowed since PHP 7.0. 

From the RFC : `Doing calls like $obj->__clone( ) is now allowed. This was the only magic method that had a compile-time check preventing some calls to it, which doesn't make sense. If we allow all other magic methods to be called, there's no reason to forbid this one`.

<?php

    class Foo {
        function __clone() {}
    }
    
    $a = new Foo;
    $a->__clone();
?>
