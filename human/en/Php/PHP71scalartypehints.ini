name = "PHP 7.1 Scalar Typehints";
description = "A new scalar typehint was introduced : iterable. 

It can't be used before PHP 7.1, and will be confused with classes or interfaces.

<?php

function foo(iterable $iterable) {
    foreach ($iterable as $value) {
        echo $value.PHP_EOL;
    }
}

foo(range(1,20)); 
// works with array

foo(new ArrayIterator([1, 2, 3])); 
// works with an iterator

foo((function () { yield 1; })() ); 
// works with a generator
