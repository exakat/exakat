description = "List of all cast usage.

PHP does not require (or support) explicit type definition in variable declaration; a variable's type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. 

<?php

if (is_int($_GET['x'])) {
    $number = (int) $_GET['x'];
} else {
    error_display('a wrong value was provided for \"x\"');
}

?>

Until PHP 7.2, a ``(unset)`` operator was available. It had the same role as ``unset()`` as a function.

         `unset <https://www.php.net/unset>`_.
