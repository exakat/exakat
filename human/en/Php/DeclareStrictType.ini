name = "Declare strict_types Usage";
description = "Usage of ``strict_types``. By default, PHP attempts to change the original type to match the type specified by the type-declaration. With an explicit ``strict_types`` declaration, PHP ensures that the incoming argument has the exact type. 

``strict_types`` were introduced in PHP 7.0.

<?php

// Setting strict_types;
    declare(strict_types = 1);

    function foo(int $i) {
        echo $i;
    }

    // Always valid : displays 1
    foo(1);
    // with strict types, this emits an error
    // without strict types, this displays 1
    foo(1.7);

?>
