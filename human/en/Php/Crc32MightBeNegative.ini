description = "crc32() may return a negative number, on 32 bits platforms.

According to the manual : Because PHP\'s integer type is signed many ``CRC32`` checksums will result in negative integers on 32 bits platforms. On 64 bits installations, all crc32() results will be positive integers though.

<?php

// display the checksum with %u, to make it unsigned
echo sprintf('%u', crc32($str));

// turn the checksum into an unsigned hexadecimal
echo dechex(crc32($str));

// avoid concatenating crc32 to a string, as it may be negative on 32bits platforms 
echo 'prefix'.crc32($str);

?>
