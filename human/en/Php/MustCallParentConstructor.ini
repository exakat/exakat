name = "Must Call Parent Constructor";
description = "Some PHP native classes require a call to parent::__construct() to be stable. 

As of PHP 7.3, two classes currently need that call : SplTempFileObject and SplFileObject.

The error is only emitted if the class is instantiated, and a parent class is called. 

<?php

class mySplFileObject extends \SplFileObject {
    public function __construct()    { 
        // Forgottent call to parent::__construct()
    }
}

(new mySplFileObject())->passthru();
?>
