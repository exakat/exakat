name = "** For Exponent";
description = "PHP has the operator ** to provide exponents, instead of the slower function pow(). This operator was introduced in PHP 5.6.

<?php
    $cube = pow(2, 3); // 8

    $cubeInPHP56 = 2 ** 3; // 8
?>

If the code needs to be backward compatible to 5.5 or less, don't use the new operator.

Be aware the the '-' operator has lower priority than the ** operator : this leads to the following confusing result.

<?php
    echo -3 ** 2;
    // displays -9, instead of 9
?>

This is due to the parser that process separately ``-`` and the following number. Since ``**`` has priority, the power operation happens first.

Being an operator, ``**`` is faster than pow(). This is a microoptimisation.
