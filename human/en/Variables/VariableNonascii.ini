name = "Non Ascii Variables";
description = "PHP supports variables with certain characters. The variable name must only include letters, figures, underscores and ASCII characters from 128 to 255. 

In practice, letters outside the scope of a-zA-Z0-9 are rare, and require more care when editing the code or passing it from OS to OS. 

<?php

class 人 {
    // An actual working class in PHP.

    }
