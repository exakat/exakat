description = "In PHP, variables may be static. They will survive after the function execution end, and will be available at the next function run. They are distinct from globals, which are available application wide, and from static properties, which are tied to a class of objects.

function foo() {
    // static variable

    echo ++$count;
}

class bar {
    // This is not a static variable : 
    // it is a static property
    static $property = 1;
}
