description = "Those are variable indirect expressions that are interpreted differently in PHP 5 and PHP 7. 

You should check them so they don't behave strangely.

<?php

// Ambiguous expression : 
$b = $$foo['bar']['baz'];
echo $b;

$foo = array('bar' => array('baz' => 'bat'));
$bat = 'PHP 5.6';

// In PHP 5, the expression above means : 
$b = $\{$foo['bar']['baz']};
$b = 'PHP 5.6';

$foo = 'a';
$a = array('bar' => array('baz' => 'bat'));

// In PHP 7, the expression above means : 
$b = ($$foo)['bar']['baz'];
$b = 'bat';
