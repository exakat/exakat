Such variables are useless. Variables must be used at least twice : once for writing, once for reading, at least. It is recommended to remove them.

In special situations, variables may be used once : 

+ PHP predefined variables, as they are already initialized. They are omitted in this analyze.
+ Interface function's arguments, since the function has no body; They are omitted in this analyze.
+ Dynamically created variables (\$\$x, \${\$this->y} or also using extract), as they are runtime values and can't be determined at static code time. They are reported for manual review.
+ Dynamically included files will provide in-scope extra variables.

The current analyzer count variables at the application level, and not at a method scope level. ";

explain="In this code, $cachedConfigData is collected after storing date in the cache. Gdn::cache()->store() does actual work, so its calling is necessary. The result, collected after execution, is not reused in the rest of the method (long method, not all is shown here). Removing such variable is a needed clean up after development and debug, but also prevents pollution of the variable namespace."
