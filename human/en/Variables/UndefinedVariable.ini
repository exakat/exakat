name = "Undefined Variable";
description = "Variable that is used before any creation. 

It is recommended to use a default value for every variable used. When not specified, the default value is set to `NULL` by PHP.

<?php

// Adapted from the PHP manual
$var = 'Bob';
$Var = 'Joe';
// The following line may emit a warning : Undefined variable: $undefined
echo "$var, $Var, $undefined";      // outputs "Bob, Joe, "


?>

Variable may be created in various ways : assignation, arguments, foreach blind variables, static and global variables.

This analysis doesn't handle dynamic variables, such as `$$x`. It also doesn't handle variables outside a method or function.
