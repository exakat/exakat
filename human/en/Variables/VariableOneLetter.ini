description = "Variables with one letter name are the shortest name for variables. They also bear very little content : what does containt $w ? 

Some short variables have meaning : $x and $y for coordinates, $i, $j, $k for blind variables. Others tend to be an easy way to give a name to a variable, without thinking too hard a good name."
