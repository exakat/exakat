name = "Rethrown Exceptions";
description = "Throwing a caught exception is usually useless and dead code.

When exceptions are caught, they should be processed or transformed, but not rethrown as is.

Those issues often happen when a catch structure was positioned for debug purposes, but lost its usage later. 

<?php

try {
    doSomething();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    throw $e;
}

?>
