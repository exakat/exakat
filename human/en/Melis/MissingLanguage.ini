In /language/en_EN.interface.php

                 'b' => 'B',
                 'c' => 'C');

In /language/fr_FR.interface.php
<?php
    return array('a' => 'A',

                 'b' => 'B2',
                 'd' => 'D');

?>

In this example, 'd' is missing in ``en_EN``, 'c' is missing in ``fr_FR``. 'b' is also reported
