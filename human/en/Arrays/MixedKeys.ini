description = "Avoid mixing constants and literals in array keys.

When defining default values in arrays, it is recommended to avoid mixing constants and literals, as PHP may mistake them and overwrite the previous with the latter.

Either switch to a newer version of PHP (5.5 or newer), or make sure the resulting array hold the expected data. If not, reorder the definitions.

<?php

const ONE = 1;

$a = [ 1   => 2,
       ONE => 3];

?>
