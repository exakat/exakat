name = "Octal Glossary";
description = "List of all the integer values using the octal format : an integer starting with an initial 0. 

<?php

  $a = 1234; // decimal number
  $a = 0123; // octal number (equivalent to 83 decimal)

  // silently valid for PHP 5.x
  $a = 01283; // octal number (equivalent to 10 decimal)

?>

Putting an initial 0 is often innocuous, but in PHP, 0755 and 755 are not the same. The second is actually 1363 in octal, and will not provide the expected privileges.
