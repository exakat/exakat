<?php

$a = 0;
$b = \"$a\"; // This is a one-variable string

// Better way to write the above
$b = (string) $a;

// Alternatives : 
$b2 = \"$a[1]\"; // This is a one-variable string
$b3 = \"$a->b\"; // This is a one-variable string
$c = \"d\";
$d = \"D\";
$b4 = \"{$$c}\";
$b5 = \"{$a->foo()}\";

?>

When the goal is to convert a variable to a string, it is recommended to use the type casting (string) operator : it is then clearer to understand the conversion. It is also marginally faster, though very little.
