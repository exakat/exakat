This module guesses the content type and encoding of a file by looking for certain magic byte sequences at specific positions within the file.

<?php
$finfo = finfo_open(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE); // return mime type ala mimetype extension
foreach (glob('*') as $filename) {
    echo finfo_file($finfo, $filename) . PHP_EOL;
}
finfo_close($finfo);
?>
