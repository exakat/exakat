description = "Extension COM and ``.Net`` (Windows).

COM is an acronym for 'Component Object Model'; it is an object orientated layer (and associated services) on top of DCE RPC (an open standard) and defines a common calling convention that enables code written in any language to call and interoperate with code written in any other language (provided those languages are COM aware).

<?php 
$domainObject = new COM("WinNT://Domain"); 
foreach ($domainObject as $obj) { 
   echo $obj->Name . "<br />"; 
} 
?>
