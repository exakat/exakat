description = "Extension international.

Internationalization extension (further is referred as Intl) is a wrapper for `ICU <http://site.icu-project.org/>`_ library, enabling PHP programmers to perform various locale-aware operations including but not limited to formatting, transliteration, encoding conversion, calendar operations, `UCA <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/>`_-conformant collation, locating text boundaries and working with locale identifiers, timezones and graphemes.

<?php
$coll = new Collator('en_US');
$al   = $coll->getLocale(Locale::ACTUAL_LOCALE);
echo "Actual locale: $al\n";

$formatter = new NumberFormatter('en_US', NumberFormatter::DECIMAL);
echo $formatter->format(1234567);
?>
