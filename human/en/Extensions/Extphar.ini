The phar extension provides a way to put entire PHP applications into a single file called a ``phar`` (PHP Archive) for easy distribution and installation. 

<?php
try {
    $p = new Phar('/path/to/my.phar', 0, 'my.phar');
    $p['myfile.txt'] = 'hi';
    $file = $p['myfile.txt'];
    var_dump($file->isCompressed(Phar::BZ2));
    $p['myfile.txt']->compress(Phar::BZ2);
    var_dump($file->isCompressed(Phar::BZ2));
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Create/modify operations on my.phar failed: ', $e;
}
?>
