The readline functions implement an interface to the GNU Readline library. These are functions that provide editable command lines.

<?php
//get 3 commands from user
for ($i=0; $i < 3; $i++) {
        $line = readline(\"Command: \");
        readline_add_history($line);
}

//dump history
print_r(readline_list_history());

//dump variables
print_r(readline_info());
?>
