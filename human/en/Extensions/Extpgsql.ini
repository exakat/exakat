PostgreSQL is an open source descendant of this original Berkeley code.  It provides SQL92/SQL99 language support, transactions, referential integrity, stored procedures and type extensibility. 

<?php
// Connect to a database named 'mary'
$dbconn = pg_connect('dbname=mary');

// Prepare a query for execution
$result = pg_prepare($dbconn, 'my_query', 'SELECT * FROM shops WHERE name = $1');

// Execute the prepared query.  Note that it is not necessary to escape
// the string 'Joe's Widgets' in any way
$result = pg_execute($dbconn, 'my_query', array('Joe\'s Widgets'));

// Execute the same prepared query, this time with a different parameter
$result = pg_execute($dbconn, 'my_query', array('Clothes Clothes Clothes'));
