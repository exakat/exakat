description = "Extension Expect.

This extension allows to interact with processes through ``PTY``. You may consider using the ``expect://`` wrapper with the filesystem functions which provide a simpler and more intuitive interface.

<?php
ini_set('expect.loguser', 'Off');

$stream = fopen('expect://ssh root@remotehost uptime', 'r');

$cases = array (
    array (0 => 'password:', 1 => PASSWORD)
);

switch (expect_expectl ($stream, $cases)) {
    case PASSWORD:
        fwrite ($stream, 'password'.PHP_EOL);
        break;
 
    default:
        die ('Error was occurred while connecting to the remote host!'.PHP_EOL);
}

while ($line = fgets($stream)) {
      print $line;
}
fclose ($stream);
