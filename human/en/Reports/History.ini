The history tables are the same as the dump.sqlite tables, except for the extra 'serial' table. Each audit comes with 3 identifiers : 

+ 'dump_timestamp' : this is a timmestamp taken when the dump was build
+ 'dump_serial'    : this is a serial number, based on the previous audit, and incremented by one. This is handy to keep the values in sequence
+ 'dump_id'        : this is a unique random id, which helps distinguish audits which may have inconsistence between serial or timestamp.

This report provides a 'history.sqlite' database. The following tables are inventoried : 

+ hash 
+ resultsCounts
