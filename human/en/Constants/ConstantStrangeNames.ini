description = "List of constants being defined with names that are incompatible with PHP standards. 

For example, define('ABC!', 1); The constant ABC! will not be accessible via the PHP syntax, such as $x = ABC!; but only with the function constant('ABC!');. It may also be tested with defined('ABC!');.";
