description = "Variable constants are actually constants whose value is accessed via the function constant(). Otherwise, there is no way to dynamically access a constant (aka, when the developer has the name of the constant as a incoming parameter, and it requires the value of it). 

<?php

const A = 'constant_value';

$constant_name = 'A';

$variableConstant = constant($constant_name);
