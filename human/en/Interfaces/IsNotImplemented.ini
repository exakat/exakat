name = "Interfaces Is Not Implemented";
description = "Classes that implements interfaces, must implements each of the interface's methods. 

<?php

class x implements i {
    // This method implements the foo method from the i interface
    function foo() {}

    // The method bar is missing, yet is requested by interface i
    function foo() {}
}

interface i {
    function foo();
    function bar(); 
}

?>

This problem tends to occurs in code that split interfaces and classes by file. This means that PHP's linting will skip the definitions and not find the problem. At execution time, the definitions will be checked, and a Fatal error will occur.

This situation usually detects code that was forgotten during a refactorisation of the interface or the class and its sibblings.
