description = "The PCRE regex doesn't compile. It isn't a valid regex.

Several reasons may lead to this situation : syntax error, Unknown modifier, missing parenthesis or reference.

<?php

// valid regex
preg_match('/[abc]/', $string);

// invalid regex (missing terminating ] for character class 
preg_match('/[abc/', $string);

?>

Dynamic regex are only checked for simple values. Dynamic values may eventually generate a compilation error.
