description = "PHP hands over a lot of information using special variables like $_GET, $_POST, etc... Modifying those variables and those values inside de variables means that the original content will be lost, while it will still look like raw data, and, as such, will be untrustworthy.

It is recommended to put the modified values in another variable, and keep the original one intact.";
