name = "Modernize Empty With Expression";
description = "empty() accepts expressions as argument. This feature was added in PHP 5.5. 

There is no need to store the expression in a variable before testing, unless it is reused later.

<?php

// PHP 5.5+ empty() usage
if (empty(foo($b . $c))) {
    doSomethingWithoutA();
}

// Compatible empty() usage
$a = foo($b . $c);
if (empty($a)) {
    doSomethingWithoutA();
}

// $a2 is reused, storage is legit
$a2 = strtolower($b . $c);
if (empty($a2)) {
    doSomething();
} else {
    echo $a2;
}

?>
