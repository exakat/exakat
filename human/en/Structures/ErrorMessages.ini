description = "Error message when an error is reported in the code. Those messages will be read by whoever is triggering the error, and it has to be helpful. 

It is a good exercise to read the messages out of context, and try to understand what is about.

<?php

// Not so helpful messages
die('Here be monsters');
exit('An error happened');
throw new Exception('Exception thrown at runtime');

?>

Error messages are spotted via die, exit or throw. ";
