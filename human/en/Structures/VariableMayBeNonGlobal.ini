name = "Variable May Be Non-Global";
description = "Static and global keywords should be used as early as possible in a method. 

Performance wise, it is better to call ``global`` or ``static`` only before using the variable. 

Human-wise, it is recommended to put ``global`` or ``static`` at the beginning of the method, for better readability.

<?php 

function foo() {
    // $a is not global yet. It is a local variable
    $a = 1;
    // Same for static variables
    $s = 5;

    // Now $a is global
    global $a;
    $a = 3;

    // Now $s is static
    static $s;
    $s = 55;
}

?>
