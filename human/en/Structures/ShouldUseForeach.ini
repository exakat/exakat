name = "Should Use Foreach";
description = "Use foreach instead of for when traversing an array.

Foreach() is the modern loop : it maps automatically every element of the array to a blind variable, and loop over it. This is faster and safer.

<?php

// Foreach version
foreach($array as $element) {
    doSomething($element);
}

// The above case may even be upgraded with array_map and a callback, 
// for the simplest one of them
$array = array_map('doSomething', $array);

// For version (one of various alternatives)
for($i = 0; $i < count($array); $i++) {
    $element = $array[$i];
    doSomething($element);
}

?>
