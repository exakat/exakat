name = "Use json_decode() Options";
description = "json_decode() returns objects by default, unless the second argument is set to ``TRUE`` or ``JSON_OBJECT_AS_ARRAY``. Then, it returns arrays.

Avoid transtyping of json_decode() returned value, and use the second argument to directly set the correct type.

<?php

$json = '{"a":"b"}';

// Good syntax
$array = json_decode($json, JSON_OBJECT_AS_ARRAY);

// GoToo much work
$array = (array) json_decode($json);

?>

Note that all objects will be turned into arrays, recursively. If you're expecting an array of objects, don't use the ``JSON_OBJECT_AS_ARRAY`` constant, and change your JSON code.

Note that ``JSON_OBJECT_AS_ARRAY`` is the only constant : there is no defined constant to explicitly ask for an object as returned value.
