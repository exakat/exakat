name = "Adding Zero";
description = "Adding 0 is useless, as 0 is the neutral element for addition. Besides, when one of the argument is an integer, PHP triggers a cast to integer. 

It is recommended to make the cast explicit with ``(int)``. 

<?php

// Explicit cast
$a = (int) foo();

// Useless addition
$a = foo() + 0;
$a = 0 + foo();

// Also works with minus
$b = 0 - $c; // drop the 0, but keep the minus
$b = $c - 0; // drop the 0 and the minus

$a += 0;
$a -= 0;

?>

Adding zero is also reported when the zero is a defined constants. 

If it is used to type cast a value to integer, then casting with ``(int)`` is clearer.
