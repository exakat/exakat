name = "No Need For Else";
description = "Else is not needed when the Then ends with a break. A break may be the following keywords : break, continue, return, goto. Any of these send the execution somewhere in the code. The else block is then executed as the main sequence, only if the condition fails.

<?php

function foo() {
    // Else may be in the main sequence.
    if ($a1) {
        return $a1;
    } else {
        $a++;
    }

    // Same as above, but negate the condition : if (!$a2) { return $a2; }
    if ($a2) {
        $a++;
    } else {
        return $a2;
    }

    // This is OK
    if ($a3) {
        return;
    }

    // This has no break
    if ($a4) {
        $a++;
    } else {
        $b++;
    }

    // This has no else
    if ($a5) {
        $a++;
    }
}
?>
