name = "Structures/CouldUseArrayFillKeys";
description = "array_fill_keys() is a native PHP function that creates an array from keys. It gets the list of keys, and a constant value to assign to each keys.

This is twice faster than doing the same with a loop.

<?php

$array = range('a', 'z');

// Fast way to build the array
$b = array_fill_key($a, 0);

// Slow way to build the array
foreach($array as $a) {
    $b[$a] = 0;
}

?>
