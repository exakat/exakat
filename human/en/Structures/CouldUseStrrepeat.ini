name = "Could Use str_repeat()";
description = "Use str_repeat() or str_pad() instead of making a loop.

Making a loop to repeat the same concatenation is actually much longer than using str_repeat(). As soon as the loop repeats more than twice, str_repeat() is much faster. With arrays of 30, the difference is significative, though the whole operation is short by itself. 

<?php

// This adds 7 'e' to $x
$x .= str_repeat('e', 7);

// This is the same as above, 
for($a = 3; $a < 10; ++$a) {
    $x .= 'e';
}

// here, $default must contains 7 elements to be equivalent to the previous code
foreach($default as $c) {
    $x .= 'e';
}

?>
