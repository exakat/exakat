name = "Property/Variable confusion";
description = "Within a class, there is both a property and some variables bearing the same name. 

class Object {
    private $x;
    
    function SetData() {
        $this->x = $x + 2;
    }
}

the property and the variable may easily be confused one for another and lead to a bug. 

Sometimes, if the property will be changed, and its value replaced by some incoming argument, or data based on such argument, this naming schema is made on purpose, indicating that the current argument will eventually end up in the property. When the argument has the same name as the property, no warning is reported.
