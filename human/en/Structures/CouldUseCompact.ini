name = "Could Use Compact";
description = "Compact() turns a group of variables into an array. It may be used to simplify expressions. 

<?php

$a = 1;
$b = 2;

// Compact call
$array = compact('a', 'b');

$array === [1, 2];

// Detailing all the keys and their value
$array = ['a' => $a, 'b' => $b];

?>

Note that compact accepts any string, and any undefined variable is not set, without a warning.
