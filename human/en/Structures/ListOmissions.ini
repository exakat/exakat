name = "list() May Omit Variables";
description = "Simply omit any unused variable in a list() call. 

list() is the only PHP function that accepts to have omitted arguments. If the following code makes no usage of a listed variable, just omit it. 

<?php
    // No need for '2', so no assignation
    list ($a, , $b) = array(1, 2, 3);
        // works with PHP 7.1 short syntax
         [$a, , $b] = array(1, 2, 3);

    // No need for '2', so no assignation
    list ($a, $c, $b) = array(1, 2, 3);
?>

project="OpenConf"
file="openconf/author/privacy.php"
line="29"
code="list($none, $OC_privacy_policy) = oc_getTemplate('privacy_policy');";
explain="The first variable in the list(), $none, isn't reused anywhere in the script. In fact, its name convey the meaning that is it useless, but is in the array nonetheless. "

[example2]
project="FuelCMS"
file="wp-admin/includes/misc.php"
line="74"
code="list($b, $a) = array(reset($params->me), key($params->me));";
explain="$a is never reused again. $b, on the other hand is. Not assigning any value to $a saves some memory, and avoid polluting the local variable space. "
