name = "Forgotten Whitespace";
description = "Those are white space that are at either end of a script : at the beginning or the end. 

<?php
    // This script has no forgotten whitespace, not at the beginning
    function foo() {}

    // This script has no forgotten whitespace, not at the end
?>

Usually, such white space are forgotten, and may end up summoning the infamous 'headers already sent' error. It is better to remove them.
