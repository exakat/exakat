name = "Variable Is Not A Condition";
description = "Avoid using a lone variable as a condition. It is recommended to use a comparative value, or one of the filtering function, such as isset(), empty(). 

Using the raw variable as a condition blurs the difference between an undefined variable and an empty value. By using an explicit comparison or validation function, it is easier to understand what the variable stands for.

<?php

if (isset($error)) {
    echo 'Found one error : '.$error!;
}

//
if ($errors) {
    print count($errors).' errors found : '.join('', $errors).PHP_EOL;
    echo 'Not found';
}

?>
