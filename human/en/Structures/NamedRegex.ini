name = "Named Regex";
description = "Captured subpatterns may be named, for easier reference. 

From the manual : It is possible to name a subpattern using the syntax ``(?P<name>pattern)``. This subpattern will then be indexed in the matches array by its normal numeric position and also by name. PHP 5.2.2 introduced two alternative syntaxes ``(?<name>pattern)`` and ``(?'name'pattern)``.

Naming subpatterns makes it easier to know what is read from the results of the subpattern : for example, ``$r['name']`` has more meaning than ``$r[1]``. 

Named subpatterns may also be shifted in the regex without impact on the resulting array. 

<?php

$x = 'abc';
preg_match_all('/(?<name>a)/', $x, $r);
print_r($r[1]);
print_r($r['name']);

preg_match(\"/(?<name>a)(?'sub'b)/\", $x, $s);
print $s[2];
print $s['sub'];

?>
