description = "Indices in an array notation such as `$array['indice']` may only be integers or string.

Boolean, Null or float will be converted to their integer or string equivalent.

Decimal numbers are rounded to the closest integer; Null is transtyped to '' (empty string); true is 1 and false is 0; Integers in strings are transtyped, while partial numbers or decimals are not analyzed in strings. 

As a general rule of thumb, only use integers or strings that don\'t look like integers. 

This analyzer may find constant definitions, when available.
