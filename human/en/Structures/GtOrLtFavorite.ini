name = "> Or < Comparisons";
description = "Maths has two comparisons styles : ``>`` or ``<``. Both may include equality : ``<=`` and ``>=``.

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It is recommended to always use the same comparison style. 

<?php

// Always compare in the same direction
if ($a > $c) {

} elseif ($c > $b) {

} else {
    // equality case
}

// Alterning comparison style lead to harder to read code
if ($b > 3) {

} elseif ($b < 3) {

}

?>
