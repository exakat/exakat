name = "Altering Foreach Without Reference";
description = "When using a foreach loop that modifies the original source, it is recommended to use referenced variables, rather than access the original value with $source[$index]. 

Using references is then must faster, and easier to read. 

foreach($source as $key => &$value) {
    $value = newValue($value, $key);
}
