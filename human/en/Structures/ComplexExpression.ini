name = "Too Complex Expression";
description = "Long expressions should be broken in small chunks, to limit complexity. 

Really long expressions tends to be error prone : either by typo, or by missing details. They are even harder to review, once the initially build of the expression is gone. 

As a general rule, it is recommended to keep expressions short. The analysis include any expression that is more than 15 tokens large : variable and operators counts as one, properties, arrays count as two. Parenthesis are also counted. 

PHP has no specific limit to expression size, so long expression are legal and valid. It is possible that the business logic requires a complex equation. 

<?php

// Why not calculate wordwrap size separatedly ? 
$a = explode(\"\n\", wordwrap($this->message, floor($this->width / imagefontwidth($this->fontsize)), \"\n\"));

// Longer but easier to read
$width = floor($this->width / imagefontwidth($this->fontsize)), \"\n\");
$a = explode(\"\n\", wordwrap($this->message, $width);

// Here, some string building, including error management with @, is making the data quite complex.
fwrite($fp, 'HEAD ' . @$url['path'] . @$url['query'] . ' HTTP/1.0' . \"\r\n\" . 'Host: ' . @$url['host'] . \"\r\n\r\n\")

// Better validation of data. 
$http_header = 'HEAD ';
if (isset($url['path'])) {
    $http_header .= $url['path'];
}
if (isset($url['query'])) {
    $http_header .= $url['query'];
}

$http_header .=  \"\r\n\";
if (isset($url['host'])) {
    $http_header .= 'Host: ' . $url['host'] . \"\r\n\r\n\";
}

fwrite($fp, $http_header);
