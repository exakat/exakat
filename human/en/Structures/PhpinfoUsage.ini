If left in the production code, it may lead to a critical leak, as any attacker gaining access to this data will know a lot about the server configuration.

It is advised to never leave that kind of instruction in a production code. 

phpinfo() may be necessary to access some specific configuration of the server : for example, apache module list are only available via phpinfo(), and apache_get(), when they are loaded.
