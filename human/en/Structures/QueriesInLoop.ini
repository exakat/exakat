description = "Avoid querying databases in a loop. 

Querying an external database in a loop usually leads to performances problems. This is also called the 'n + 1 problem'. 

It is recommended to reduce the number of queries by making one query, and dispatching the results afterwards. This is true with SQL databases, graph queries, LDAP queries, etc. 

<?php

// Typical N = 1 problem : there will be as many queries as there are elements in $array
$ids = array(1,2,3,5,6,10);

$db = new SQLite3('mysqlitedb.db');

// all the IDS are merged into the query at once
$results = $db->query('SELECT bar FROM foo WHERE id  in ('.implode(',', $id).')');
while ($row = $results->fetchArray()) {
    var_dump($row);
}


// Typical N = 1 problem : there will be as many queries as there are elements in $array
$ids = array(1,2,3,5,6,10);

$db = new SQLite3('mysqlitedb.db');

foreach($ids as $id) {
    $results = $db->query('SELECT bar FROM foo WHERE id = '.$id);
    while ($row = $results->fetchArray()) {
        var_dump($row);
    }
}

?>

This is not always possible.
