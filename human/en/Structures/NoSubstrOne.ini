name = "No Substr() One";
description = "Use array notation ``$string[$position]`` to reach a single byte in a string.

There are two ways to access a byte in a string : substr() and ``$v[$pos]``.

The second style is more readable. It may be up to four times faster, though it is a micro-optimization. It is recommended to use it. 

PHP 7.1 also introduces the support of negative offsets as string index : negative offset are also reported.

<?php

$string = ab人cde;

echo substr($string, $pos, 1);
echo $string[$pos];
echo mb_substr($string, $pos, 1);

// $pos = 1
// bbb
// $pos = 2
// ??人

?>

Beware that substr() and ``$v[$pos]`` are similar, while mb_substr() is not. The first function works on bytes, while the latter works on characters.";
