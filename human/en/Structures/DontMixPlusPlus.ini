description = "++ operators have two distinct behaviors, and should be used in isolation.

When mixed with a larger expression, it is difficult to read, and may lead to unwanted behaviors.

    // Clear and defined behavior
    $i++;
    $a[$i] = $i;

    // $i is modified twice 
    $i = --$i + 1;
