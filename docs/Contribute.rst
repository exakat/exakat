Exakat is an Open Source project. It is also organized to collect common knowledge and encode it in its databases.

Here are some suggestions of help you may provide to enhance your own usage of Exakat : 

* Suggest PHP extensions that are missing in the list of supported extensions (see :any:`Annex`)
* Suggest new analysis, with examples of target code, and examples of good code
* Suggest missing external services
* Report installation or usage problems
* Suggest interesting Coding reference, like Object Calisthenics, PSR, East-Oriented Programming, etc.
* Other ideas...
